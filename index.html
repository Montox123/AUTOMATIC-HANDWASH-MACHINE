                <h3> In these time, we are facing a lot of problem due to Corona virus, many shopping malls, food plaza , restaurants, shops
                     are closed and the economy of all over World is falling down.The people can't afford sensor based product and they have to shut there restaurants, food store, shops etc. 
                    If they are opening, they are not using the good practices, which leads to the spread of corona virus as the
                     taps of the wash basins are touched by every people and no one knows who is contaminated with the virus and this is a global issue now. 
                    In that situation I thought of building something which will be helpful for our society. I will build a cost efficient  AUTOMATIC HANDWASH MACHINE
                     which will fit on the existing taps of the wash basins of Restaurants and Shopping </h3>
                    
                    <h1> WORKING </h1>  
                    
                    <h3>It works with the help of servo motor, arduino, sensor. The sensor will detect the hand which is shown by human 
                        and the motor will rotate anticlockwise to open the tap of wash basin, and as per requirement the tap will close after 20 sec or 15 sec. </h3>
                    
                   <h1>ADVANTAGE</h1> 
                    
                  <h3>  The following product will prevent people from touching the taps that will reduce the spread of corona.
                    This will make people's life easy and corona free at some extent and also save some water of our Mother Earth. </h3>
